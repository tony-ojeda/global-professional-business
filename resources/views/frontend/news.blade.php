is one constant source of pride for Peruvians and that is our cuisine.
Ceviche, huanca√≠na potato, rice with duck... dishes that we are
accustomed to and enjoy very much, have left the world open-
mouthed.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">
How can we not be proud of our gastronomy! If in 2017 Peru was
considered the best world culinary destination in the World Travel
Awards (WTA), for the sixth consecutive year. These awards are &quot;the
Oscars of tourism&quot; and the recognition is deserved for the seven
reasons that we will point out to you here.
